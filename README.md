# Homecooked
Homecooked is an online platform which connects home chefs who love cooking with a community of hungry eaters. Home cooks can sign up, offer their best dishes, cook in bulk and connect with eaters eager for homemade lunches or dinners. Eaters can choose from an array of local, home-cooked meals, connect with a chef and arrange for a food delivery or pick-up.
